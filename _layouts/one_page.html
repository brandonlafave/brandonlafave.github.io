        <a id="portfolio"></a>
        <p class="center-element">My name is Brandon LaFave, and I'm a front-end developer who lives in Seattle. While working at Amazon, I was involved in several major launches, such as the opening of Kindle store in Netherlands and the release of Kindle Text Creator. I also initiated, created, and defined the media-query standards that Kindle teams throughout the world use for eBooks.</p>

          <p class="center-element">Bibliopile allows users to search and borrow books from their friends' libraries. I completed it with three other developers under a four-day sprint. I used semantic HTML5, Sass, AJAX, JavaScript, and Angular. <a href="bibliopile">[More Info]</a></p>
